# Vulnerability Scanner

##  Overview  
Software vulnerabilities are one of the critical issues in the current software development; these vulnerabilities can pose a serious risk of exploitation and result in system compromise, information leaks, and even further financial loss. Unfortunately,
testing and manual code reviews cannot always find every vulnerability. To solve the problem we ae using an efficient ML-driven approach to solve this ever growing cybersecurity issue.
