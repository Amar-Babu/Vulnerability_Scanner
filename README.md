# Vulnerability Scanner

##  Overview  
Software vulnerabilities are one of the critical issues in the current software development; these vulnerabilities can pose a serious risk of exploitation and result in system compromise, information leaks, and even further financial loss. Unfortunately,
testing and manual code reviews cannot always find every vulnerability. To solve the problem we are using an efficient ML-driven approach to solve this ever growing cybersecurity issue.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3**: Python 3.7+
2. **Tensorflow 2**: Tensorflow 2.0.0+
3. **Pandas**: Pandas 1.2.3
4. **Jupyter Notebook** Notebook 6.2.0
5. **CUDA Toolkit** The version matches your Tensorflow version. The code works fine without GPU support, but GPU support is highly recommanded.

## Installation
1. Check the version of the dependencies on your machine.

2. Clone the project
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Jiawen-Zhang/Vulnerability_Scanner
```

3. Download the dataset [here](https://osf.io/d45bw/); put the files into `Vulnerability_Scanner/dataset`

4. Use the `data_formatting.ipynb` to convert the dataset to the format that can be used by our models.

5. To start a taining process, go to `Vulnerability_Scanner/model`. The `Simple_CNN_binary.ipynb` is a binary classifier; you can use this model to detect if the source code contains a vulnerability in our monitored classes.
