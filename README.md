# c_vulnerability_scanner

# Installing
## Prerequisites
1. gcc: `gcc` is required for preprocessing.
1. **Python 3.8**: `numpy` requires py3.7+

## Installation process
1. Check that `poetry` is already installed.
```bash
$ poetry -V
Poetry version 1.1.4
```
2. Setting that `poetry` will create the virtualenv in our project.
```bash
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
3. Clone the project
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ZhangYue-vhyt/c_vulnerability_scanner.git
$ cd c_vulnerability_scanner
```
4. Install with poetry
```bash
$ poetry install
